# JavaScript Concepts and Code Examples

Welcome to the JavaScript Concepts and Code Examples repository. This platform is designed as an ultimate learning resource for both novices beginning their programming journey and seasoned developers seeking to refresh their knowledge on specific JavaScript concepts. From fundamental basics to advanced topics, this comprehensive guide navigates through the expansive world of JavaScript.

## Description

The backbone of interactive web development, mastering JavaScript, is essential for anyone aiming to excel in the tech industry. This repository is meticulously organized into categories, each dedicated to a specific aspect of JavaScript, ranging from foundational topics like "Variables" and "Data Types" to more complex subjects such as "Asynchronous JavaScript," "Promises," and "Web APIs."

Each category serves as a portal to in-depth exploration, breaking down into key concepts with straightforward explanations and illustrative code examples. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive learning experience, allowing you to build a robust foundation before venturing into more complex areas.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

This project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) along with several other libraries and technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Apollo Client**: A comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for your API and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Bootstrap & React-Bootstrap**: Front-end frameworks for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **Helmet**: A React component that manages all of your changes to the document head.

## Deployed Application

This application is deployed on Heroku, you can view the live application here [https://jsconcepts-619c289c467a.herokuapp.com/](https://jsconcepts-619c289c467a.herokuapp.com/)
## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB

### Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kandekore/js-terms.git
cd js-terms
```

2. Install dependencies for the server:

Navigate to the root directory of the project and run:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Install dependencies for the client:

Navigate to the client directory and run:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```


### Running the Application

In the project's root directory, you can start both the front-end React application and the back-end server with a single command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command has been configured to use `concurrently` to run both the server and client in parallel. Ensure you have followed the instructions from the previous answer to update the `scripts` section in your `package.json`.

### Accessing the Application

- The front-end React application will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- The back-end server will be accessible on [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) for GraphQL queries.

## Features

- Comprehensive guide covering JavaScript concepts from basics to advanced.
- Interactive examples to illustrate each concept.
- Search functionality to find concepts quickly.
- Responsive design for learning on any device.
